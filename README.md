Sorry for the lagging documentation - to be updated some day.

## What?

tesla-cron is a linux cron job which runs each hour and starts charging of your tesla when prices are cheapest.

- Can be configured with google calendar/ical links to ensure tesla is charged before next calender event with a "[T]" tag in the title.
- Currently hardcoded for prices at "DK2" zone (which is in denmark)
